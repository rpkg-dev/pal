# TODOs

-   systematically rely on pkg [xfun](https://yihui.name/xfun/) whenever sensible

-   add a [standards-conformant changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) for v0.1.0 but use pkg [fledge](https://cynkra.github.io/fledge/) to generate it from
    Git commits (note the [special rules](https://cynkra.github.io/fledge/articles/fledge.html) to mark commit msgs for in-/exclusion in the changelog)

-   release on CRAN
