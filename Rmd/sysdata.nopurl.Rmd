# NOTES

-   This file is *not* included in the [source package](https://r-pkgs.org/structure.html#sec-source-package) because of the [`.nopurl` suffix in its
    filename](https://pkgpurl.rpkg.dev/reference/purl_rmd.html#-rmd-files-excluded-from-purling).

-   The chunks below have to be manually executed in order to regenerate the package data.

-   Although the datasets below are saved as ["internal data" in `R/sysdata.rda`](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-sysdata), they can still be exported and
    documented (by documenting the dataset's quoted name in the main `.Rmd` source file -- which only works when the dataset is also `@export`ed), something
    [not explicitly mentioned](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2018/12/10/r-packages-internal-and-external-data/) in the book [R
    Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-data). To do so, you first need to manually add the `export()` directive in the NAMESPACE file since
    roxygen2 won't add it automatically.

# Setup

```{r}
library(rlang,
        include.only = "%|%")
library(magrittr,
        include.only = c("%>%", "%<>%", "%T>%", "%!>%", "%$%"))
```

# Define data

## `mime_types_exts`

```{r}
mime_types_exts <- c(mime::mimemap,
                     setdiff(mime:::mimeextra, mime::mimemap),
                     # MIME types not yet included in pkg mime
                     webp = "image/webp")
```

# Write data

Save all the small data objects as a single internal file `R/sysdata.rda`. Note that when documenting them, they must be explicitly `@export`ed to be available
to package users.

```{r}
usethis::use_data(mime_types_exts,
                  internal = TRUE,
                  overwrite = TRUE,
                  compress = "xz",
                  version = 3L)
```
