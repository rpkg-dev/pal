# pal: Convenience Functions for the Typical R Coder
```{r, prep-snippets, echo = FALSE}
# download the snippets to insert later on
## define temporary file paths
file_path_installation_notice_dev <- tempfile(pattern = "installation_notice_dev_")
file_path_literate_programming_notice <- tempfile(pattern = "literate_programming_notice_")

## download the files
download.file(url = "https://gitlab.com/salim_b/r/snippets/raw/master/R%20Markdown/installation_notice_dev_version_gitlab.Rmd",
              destfile = file_path_installation_notice_dev,
              quiet = TRUE)

This package combines a variety of convenience functions which aren't found in any other tidyverse-style R packages[^notify].


[^notify]: If you discover one or more of the features of this package in a more popular tydiverse-style package, feel free to report it to me and I will consider removing it. I strongly support standardization efforts and the avoidance of duplication.
